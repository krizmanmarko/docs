My understanding is that we only (page) fault in kernel-space for the vmalloc & exception fixups (like copy_to|from_user). Any other fault in kernel-mode is a bug and an Oops occurs.

arch/riscv/include/asm/page.h: unmodified: line 30 of 191 [15%]
/*
 * PAGE_OFFSET -- the first address of the first page of memory.
 * When not using MMU this corresponds to the first free page in
 * physical memory (aligned on a page boundary).
 */

--- clear up cache (/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches)
free && sync && echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches && free
