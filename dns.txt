Ingress filtering - external traffic reaching internal
RRset - set of all TYPE (A, AAAA, ...) records on this ns
RPZ - response policy zone
Anycast - single IP multiple machines (check out routing/network.txt for more)
label - domain name (wiki.arnes.si)

in-addr.arpa -> is a label but with IP
1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.		IN	PTR	hello.com

DNS usually runs over UDP unless packets are too big

Query Types
===========
1. Recursive query
You either get the 'IP' or 'not found' no matter the cost

2. Iterative query
You may be redirected to other ns
you must repeat your query with provided ns


A: domain name -> IPv4
AAAA: domain name -> IPv6
PTR: IPv4 -> domain name
AXFR: transfer whole zone file (privileged only)

	axfr
	notify:
		- server notifies slave
		- slave queries SOA to check serial number
		- slave does axfr / ixfr

dnssec specific
DNSKEY: public dnssec key (public ZSK or KSK)
RRSIG: signature of RRset signed with private ZSK
RRSIG: signature of ZSK signed with private KSK
DS: delegation signer (hash of child zone public KSK)


Return codes
============

0 = NOERR, no error
1 = FORMERR, format error (unable to understand the query)
2 = SERVFAIL, name server problem
3 = NXDOMAIN, domain name does not exist
4 = NOTIMPL, not implemented
5 = REFUSED (e.g., refused zone transfer requests)

Bits
====
AA - authoritative answer
	server is authoritative for domain if it contains its A or AAAA record
TC - truncated response
RD - recursion desired
RA - recursion available
AD - authentic data
CD - checking disabled
DO - DNSSEC answer OK

DNSSEC
======

https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/how-dnssec-works/

ZSK - zone signing key
	signs ANY RRset (adds RRSIG for any RRset)
KSK - key signing key
	signs DNSKEY RRset (adds RRSIG for DNSKEY)

1. Request the desired RRset, which also returns the corresponding RRSIG record.
2. Request the DNSKEY records containing the public ZSK and public KSK, which also returns the RRSIG for the DNSKEY RRset.
3. Verify the RRSIG of the requested RRset with the public ZSK.
4. Verify the RRSIG of the DNSKEY RRset with the public KSK.


Example
-------

127.0.0.1

A RRset = list of IPv4 addresses
A.RRSIG (created using ZSK)

AAAA RRset = list of IPv6 addresses
AAAA.RRSIG (created using ZSK)

DNSKEY RRset = {DNSKEY zsk, DNSKEY ksk}
DNSKEY.RRSIG (created using KSK)

1. request A RRset
	received A RRset
	received A.RRSIG
	You would like to check if signature is correct
	2. request DNSKEY RRset
		received public ZSK
		received public KSK
		received DNSKEY.RRSIG
	using public KSK you can check the signature of DNSKEY RRset
using ZSK you can check the signature of A RRset

DS explanation
parent zone has a DS record --> DS hash(child's public KSK)


QNAME minimization (higher anonimity)
=====================================
fully qualified name (name that unambigiously represents something)
in dns context this is the domain name

QNAME minimization is used to share the smallest subset of the domain name
with the authoratitative server

example
-------

visiting wiki.arnes.si

you could
1. request wiki.arnes.si on .
2. request wiki.arnes.si on si.
3. request wiki.arnes.si on arnes.si.
now you have the IP address

but you could minimize QNAME (wiki.arnes.si)
1. request si on .
2. request arnes.si on si.
3. request wiki.arnes.si on arnes.si.
now you have the IP address

The difference is that root ns (.) only knows you are searching for .si domain
and not the whole QNAME wiki.arnes.si


Response Policy Zones (RPZ)
===========================
basically firewall na DNS levelu

triggers:
	QNAME
	Client IP Address
	Response IP Address
	NSDNAME
	NSIP

possible actions:
	NXDOMAIN (no record for this name does not exist)
	NODATA (record for this name exists, but the type is different)
	PASSTHRU
	DROP
	TCP-Only


check TOR via dns
=================

-- actually find out if tor node with dns query
https://piraces.dev/short-bits/check-if-an-ip-comes-from-tor-is-browsing-with-to
r/

-- get the full list
https://check.torproject.org/torbulkexitlist
https://www.dan.me.uk/torlist/?exit

dig <ip-in-reverse>.dnsel.torproject.org.
ip in reverse for 192.168.1.2 = 2.1.168.192
in ce return 127.0.0.X (X != 1) je tor


What is Authority?
==================

Any DNS server that contains a complete copy of the domain's zone file
is considered to be authoritative for that domain only. A complete copy
of a zone file must have:

- A valid Start of Authority (SOA) record
- Valid Name Server (NS) records for the domain
- The listed NS records should match the servers listed in the SOA
  record. Servers listed in the zone file, but not in the SOA record
  are called lame servers.
