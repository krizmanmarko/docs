Why you shouldn't allocate stuff on the stack
=============================================

Stack allocations should not be accessed after the function returns.
If you want permanent allocation use heap or .data / .bss

otherwise there is no reason why you shouldn't allocate char arr[1000000]
(beware that stack will not grow like heap does (mmap). It will just cause
segfault)
