What I always do: grep -Rl $search and start opening files one by one in vim
:Ex **//$search

*/filepath   files in current directory which satisfy filepath
**/filepath  files in current directory or below which satisfy the
            file pattern
*//pattern  files in the current directory which contain the
            pattern (vimgrep is used)
**//pattern files in the current directory or below which contain
            the pattern (vimgrep is used)

Enter: Opens a directory or a file.
-: Go up to the parent directory.
u: Go back to the previous directory in the history.
gb: Jump to the most recent directory saved on the "Bookmarks". To create a bookmark we use mb.

usual vim
=========

^O -> represents CTRL-O
:help vi_diff

": -> contains last command-line
"% -> contains file name

(insert)^O -> execute one normal command and return to inster mode

^D/^T -> indentation
^R{regname} -> "{regname}p
