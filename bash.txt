Job control
===========

 - suspend now
 - suspend when read() is called (not working in linux)
%n -> job n
%pattern -> job containing '^pattern' in cmdline
%?pattern -> job containing 'pattern' in cmdline
%% %+ % -> current job
%- -> previous job

fg %% -> run job %%
'%1 &' 'bg %1' -> run job %1 in background

--- Extras ---

ctrl -> C-
alt -> M-
print autocomplete options: M-?

bash -x (improves debugability)

bash setuid (bash -p)

ctrl-s - ctrl-q

close stdin: 0<&-

cut off extension: ${file%.txt}
