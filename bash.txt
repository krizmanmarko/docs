--: signals the end of options and disables further option processing. Any args
    after it are treated as filenames and arguments. An arg of - is equal to --

$*: "$1c$2c..." where c is first character in IFS
$@: "$1" "$2" ...
$#: number of positional parameters in decimal (length($@))
$?: exit code
$-: print current set of options (search for "option-name" in man bash)
$$: pid of current shell (even if invoked in subshell)
$!: pid of last backgrounded job
$0: name of script
$_: arguments of previous command / at startup absolute path where bash started

!$: last argument of previous command
!^: first argument of previous command

$RANDOM: randint in [0, 32767]

=~: string =~ regex matching


for i in {0..9} ; do list ; done
for (( i=0 ; i=10 ; i=i+1 )) ; do list ; done

# selection happens until a break command is executed
# line read is stored in $REPLY

Job control
===========

 - suspend now
 - suspend when read() is called (not working in linux)
%n -> job n
%pattern -> job containing '^pattern' in cmdline
%?pattern -> job containing 'pattern' in cmdline
%% %+ % -> current job
%- -> previous job

fg %% -> run job %%
'%1 &' 'bg %1' -> run job %1 in background

--- Extras ---

ctrl -> C-
alt -> M-
for vi mode keybindings check man readline.3
vi-mode (in normal mode):
= -> print all possible completions (but tab is better...)
* -> print all possible completions as args

^pattern^replace^ <- basically runs sed on previous command and launches that
!# <- prints entire line typed so far

bash -x (improves debugability)

bash setuid (bash -p)

-- [fd]<>file (open file with fd fd)
https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/io-redirection.html

echo 123456789 >myfile
exec 3<>myfile	# open("myfile", O_RDWR) -> returns 3
read -n 4 <&3
echo -n . >&3
exec 3>&-	# close(3)
cat myfile	# 1234.6789

[fd]>&-		# close(input fd)
[fd]<&-		# close(output fd)

close stdin: 0<&-
close stdout: 1>&-

command1 |& command2 is equivalent to command1 2>&1 | command2

here document
cat << "EOF"
hahaha
EOF

here string
cat <<< "this is direct input to program"
