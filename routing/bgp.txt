BGP - Border gateway protocol

autonomous system (AS) prerequisites:
	- find the best route
	- discover changes in network

peer
is a device on the border of autonomous system
responsible for constructing network graph


keep-alive is the timeout for checking availability of other peers

external BGP (eBGP)
internal BGP (iBGP)

BGP attributes
==============

weight
local preference: exit path for AS
???originate (1 bit value): did this router create this table entry? - if true use those as well
AS path length

RPKI - resource public key infrastructure
ROA - route origin authorization
	this is just a signed record telling if this BGP peer has the rights
	to change BGP routing tables

BGP Anycast
===========

machines are assigned the same IP
this way all routers think this is just one address (/ machine)
routers can do their magic without modifications
